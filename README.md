# Bookshelf

Bookshelf is a web app to record the book you've read. Actually this is just me trying out Hanami.

## Setup

```bash
# How to run tests:
% bundle exec rake

# How to run the development console:
% bundle exec hanami console

# How to run the development server:
% bundle exec hanami server

# How to prepare (create and migrate) DB for `development` and `test` environments:
% bundle exec hanami db prepare # Development
% HANAMI_ENV=test bundle exec hanami db prepare # Test
```
